# Exercise: Full Stack Coworking

This project will test your ability to build a RESTful API from scratch. This project should utilize the following technologies:

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Instructions

You will be building a full-stack API with the following resources based off of a coworking space. In addition to the specified fields, you should include the `_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` fields.

- **Unit:** The **Unit** resource is a generic term for a rentable space.
  - **kind:** (Required) The kind of unit available. _Only_ the following options should be allowed: "seat", "desk", "small office", "large office", "floor".
  - **floor:** (Required) An integer which represents the floor the rentable unit is on.
  - **special_monthly_offer:** An optional integer field. If filled in, represents a special deal that the company will be paying _in cents_. For example, if the unit is being leased for $600/mo, this field would be `600000`.
  - **company:** The **Company** resource, listed below.
- **Company:** The company that is leasing the rentable unit.
  - **name:** (Required) The name of the company.
  - **contact_email:** (Required) An email address that is used to contact the company. This should be [validated](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html) so that only a valid email can be entered.
  - **employees:** An array of the **Employee** resource, listed below.
- **Employee:** An employee at a given company.
  - **first_name:** (Required) The given first name of the employee.
  - **last_name:** (Required) The given last name of the employee.
  - **preferred_name:** The preferred name (i.e. nickname) of the employee.
  - **position:** The employee's title at the company.
  - **birthday:** The employee's date of birth.
  - **email:** (Required) An email address to contact the given employee. This should be [validated](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html) so that only a valid email can be entered.

Your API should include the following routes with the specified functionality.
